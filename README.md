# NBA Player Twitter Network
A little visualization of nba player networks on twitter. Uses d3 inside of react. React obviously is not needed, but I wanted
to see how to integrate a third party lib that uses the dom.

# Demo

# Data
The data is from twitter. The players list is from https://twitter.com/TheNBPA/lists/nba-players/members?lang=en.
A couple of players are missing because of privacy settings.
